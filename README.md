Hello! My name is Enzo Marcano

I'm an applied math major concentrating in data science from UC Berkeley but my actual studies consist of math, stats, data, and econ. 

I currently work in finance doing things ranging from data cleanup to portfolio optimization. On my own time, I've been trying to build a foundation of
knowledge to apply mathematical techniques to solve problems in economics; I'm currently learning Time Series Analysis, Machine Learning, and Stochastic 
Processes. I've also taken a handful of related courses such as Optimization, Economic Modeling, Probability, Numerical Analysis, Computational Statistics,
and probably some other courses I'm forgetting to mention.

Outside of my professional life, I work on programming projects which interest me such as a linear program solver, poker simulations, monopoly simulations,
monte carlo simulations for finance, and various other misc projects. My favorite language right now is Julia and I try to use it whenever I can. But I 
often use R and Python for data science and multi-faceted projects respectively.

Finally, in my personal life, I spend my time cooking, swimming, or watching Kitchen Nightmares.
